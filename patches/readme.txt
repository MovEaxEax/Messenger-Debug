These classes have to be patched in the Assembly-CSharp.dll, before you actually can start the mod. Just open the cs files, take the class-names (There are multiple in each file)
and replace the code in the files with the original one, then recompile.

side note: You have to include the xNyu-classes first, the save the module, reload and after this you can apply the patches.
